# Arduino Projects Collection

Welcome to the **Arduino Projects Collection**! This repository contains a series of interesting and beginner-friendly Arduino projects. Each project demonstrates different aspects of Arduino programming and hardware interfacing.

## How to Use

1. Each project is contained in its own folder with the necessary Arduino code. Navigate to the folder of the project you want to try, and upload the code to your Arduino board.

2. Follow the wiring instructions included in each project’s folder to build the circuit.

## Components Needed

Most of the projects in this repository require basic Arduino components. Here’s a list of common items you’ll need:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- ESP32 board
- Ultrasonic distance sensor
- LEDs (various colors)
- Push buttons
- Buzzer (active or passive)
- Resistors (220Ω for LEDs, 10kΩ for buttons)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Customization

Feel free to modify the projects to suit your needs or to add more features. Each project’s code is open-source and free to modify. Experiment with different sensors, change the timing, add more components, and create your own variations!

## License
