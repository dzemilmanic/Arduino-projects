# Arduino LED Control with Button

This project demonstrates how to control an LED using a button on an Arduino. The LED turns on when the button is pressed and turns off when the button is released.

## Features

- LED turns on when the button is pressed.
- LED turns off when the button is released.
- Simple and beginner-friendly project to learn about digital input and output.

## How It Works

1. The LED is connected to a digital pin (pin 2).
2. The button is connected to another digital pin (pin 4).
3. In the `loop()` function:
   - If the button is pressed (i.e., the button input reads `HIGH`), the LED is turned on.
   - If the button is not pressed (i.e., the button input reads `LOW`), the LED is turned off.

## Components Needed

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- 1 LED
- 1 push button
- Resistors (220Ω for the LED, 10kΩ for the button)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram

- Connect the LED to digital pin 2 through a 220Ω resistor.
- Connect one side of the button to digital pin 4 and the other side to the ground.
- Use a 10kΩ pull-down resistor to ensure a stable input when the button is not pressed.

## Code

The Arduino sketch is included in the `control_leds.ino` file in this repository. Upload it to your Arduino board to start playing.

## How to Play

1. Power on the Arduino to start the project.
2. Press the button to turn on the LED.
3. Release the button to turn off the LED.
4. Experiment with modifying the project to control multiple LEDs or add different behaviors.

## Customization

- You can modify the project to control more LEDs or add additional buttons.
- Adjust the behavior of the LED (e.g., blink on button press) by changing the logic in the program.
