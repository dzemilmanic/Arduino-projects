# 🖥️ Scrolling Text on I2C LCD with Arduino

This project displays a **scrolling message** on a **16x2 I2C LCD** using an Arduino board. The message continuously scrolls from right to left on the screen.

📁 **File**: `lcd_text.ino`

---

## ✨ Features

- ⏩ Scrolls custom text across the LCD
- 💡 Uses a 16x2 LCD with I2C interface
- 🔁 Repeats the scrolling effect in a loop
- ⚡ Simple and minimal setup

---

## 🛠️ Components Needed

- 🧠 Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
- 🖵 16x2 LCD with I2C module
- 🔌 Breadboard and jumper wires
- 💻 Arduino IDE

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The message scrolls across the LCD screen one character at a time.
- After completing the scroll, it resets and starts again.
- The I2C interface simplifies wiring and reduces pin usage.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. 🔧 Connect the I2C LCD to your Arduino according to standard SDA/SCL pins.
2. 🖥 Open the Arduino IDE and load the `lcd_text.ino` file.
3. ⬆️ Upload the code to your Arduino.
4. 📺 Watch your custom message scroll on the LCD display.
